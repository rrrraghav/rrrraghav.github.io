      <p class="lead">
        <br />
        I was born in New Delhi, India. By the time I was 13 years old, I had also lived in Bangalore, Tokyo, and New Jersey.
        <br /><br />
        Because of my unique upbringing, I have learned about and experienced vastly different cultures and perspectives. As a result, I often find myself assessing problems and designing solutions after considering multiple diverse inputs.

        <br />
        I have been playing the guitar for over a decade now, and can also produce <b>music</b> and play the piano. I have performed in front of large and small audiences, and some of my best memories are from these shows. Currently, I am on the e-board for Northeastern’s Indian music club, NU Aaroh, as the Planning and Scheduling Coordinator, where I’m responsible for organizing spaces for events and practices. <br /><br />
        I also love <b>experiencing new places</b>. I spent my freshman year of college in Oakland, California, and also explored the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles. While traveling, I really enjoy taking pictures and talking to and learning from new people. <br /><br />
        I was captain of the cross country team at my high school, and the habit of <b>working out</b> has been instilled in me since then. I enjoy being active, whether that's through running, going to the gym, playing cricket with friends, or going rock climbing.
